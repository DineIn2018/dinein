DineIn: How to Run

1)  Install node.js (if you don't already have it)
    https://nodejs.org/en/
    
2)  Install Ionic
    Run:
    $ npm install -g ionic cordova
    
3)  Clone our Github repo
    https://github.com/DineIn2018/dinein.git
    
4)  Checkout the branch ITERATION_3

5)  In terminal, cd to the directory where you have the repo cloned

6)  Install all the node.js dependencies
    Run:
    $ npm install
    
7.1)  If you don't have an iPad
      Run:
      $ ionic serve
      This will open a tab in your browser, running the app.
      
      * Note:
        At the login page, it is not necessary to enter a username or password.
        This will look real ugly, our application is meant to be deployed on an iPad, it will look better there
        Some scrolling also won't work in the browser, it will work on the iPad
        The browser is just a debugging platform
      
      **********************************************************************************************************
      * IMPORTANT:
      * When the browser is opened with the app, an error will show initially
      * This is due to a bug in a plugin we used to handle drag and drop called interactJS (not our fault!)
      * The program's functionality works fine though, even with this bug, it just affects it at compile time
      * To make the error go away, while ionic is serving and your browser showing the error page,
      * open up any typescript (.ts) file within the pages folder in our project and save it (no need to modify)
      * The error should go away and the app will run smoothly
      **********************************************************************************************************
      
7.2)  If you have an iPad
      Download the Ionic Dev App from the app store on your iPad
      On your laptop, in the project directory, run:
      $ ionic serve -c
      Make sure your laptop and iPad are on the same Wifi network
      Open the Ionic Dev App, DineIn should pop up, tap it to run the app
      
      * Note: If you are on UW Wifi, you will have to add the IP address manually
              See the terminal running the serve for the IP address and port is always 8100
